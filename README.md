# 1-tala
Hi! I am Nils and this is my first programming project.
I try to adhere to "good programming" style, but for now I am not so sure what that actually means.
Everything is new to me, so I explore not only Git and GitHub, but also connecting anaconda with spyder and whatever might be possible.

Also, the emoticons feature is fantastic :tea: :coffee: :tea:

This line is modified on my local repository and pushed to the GitHub repository.
